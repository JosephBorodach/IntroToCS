/* 
Make a tax machine that can do the following
1) Look at input line
2) Assess data from input line
3) Save data to make calculations
4) Use those calculations to keep track of larger balance. 
5) Constantly inform user of current balance 
6) Report final balance to user

	- Actual operations

*/

/*
Pseudo Code: 
1) Declare the Variables which will be reused throughout the code

2) Check to see if the next space on the input line is a valid digit

	3) If it is a valid digit, save the digit to op1 and move to (5)
	4) If it is not a valid digit, then go to LASTSTEP and end the program. 

5) Check to see if there is a valid operator

	6) If there was not a valid operator, then skip to (12).
	7) If there was a valid operator, save it to operator and then go to (8). 

8) Check to see if there is another digit: 

8a)	If there is not another valid digit, print the following
	
	"The " + (fill in whatever operator was input) + " operator must be preceded by, and followed by, numeric operands"

8b) If there was another valid digit, save it to op2

9) Perform the calculation

10) Add the total calculation to the currentBalance

There is supposed to be an exponentiate method here, but I do not really understand that

11) If there was no operator, then calculate op1 into the currentBalance. 

12) Check to see if there the balance went below $500
Now, no matter what the current "calculation" was computed into currentBalance 
so regardless of if there was an operator or not, we are here. 

	13) If it did go below $500, compute two calculations and print three strings:
		Inform user: 
			(a) bellow 500 
			(b) 20$ penalty
			(c) subtract 20$ from his currentBalance and report the balance.  
			current balance

		Compute two calculations:
			a) Update the current balance by subtracting 20$
			b) Add the $20 penalty to the totalPenalties 

		After this, return to (2)

	14) If it did not go bellow $500, inform the user only of his updated balance. 

15) return to (2)



LAST STEP) Provide reports and end program
	a) Output 20 stars
	b) Report final balance to the user
	c) Report to the user total charges in penalties
	d) End program
