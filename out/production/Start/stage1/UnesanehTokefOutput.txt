On Rosh Hashanah they will be inscribed and on Yom Kippur they will be sealed

who by water and who by fire
who by sword and who by beast
who by famine and who by thirst
who by upheaval and who by plague
who by strangling and who by stoning

On Rosh Hashanah they will be inscribed and on Yom Kippur they will be sealed

who will rest and who will wander
who will live in harmony and who will be harried
who will enjoy tranquility and who will suffer
who will be impoverished and who will be enriched
who will be degraded and who will be exalted

Repentance, Prayer, and Charity annul the severity of the Decree
