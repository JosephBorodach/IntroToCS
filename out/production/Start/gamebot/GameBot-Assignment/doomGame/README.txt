* GameBot is due Friday, February 11, 11:59 AM. There is no "A" and "B" split submission for this assignment.

* You must complete, and submit to CodePost, every Java file enclosed in this zip file (except for GameBotDemo, which is just a demo, and Weapon.java and MonsterType.java, which have been given to you in their entirety)

* As always, the given API is just the API, which means you can add as many additional private or protected methods as you want, but you MAY NOT add any additional public methods

* To really write a good GameBot that would work in many different scenarios is a an AI Planning (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_planning_and_scheduling) problem, and NOT one you are required to solve for this assignment. You will only be given inputs of very simple cases that have very simple solutions, and can be played / won using the logic described in the comments in GameBot.java

* Note: Weapon.java and MonsterType.java are good review about enums

* GameBotDemo is given as a demo/example only - it is not test code

* Also attached is the output from a run of GameBotDemo.java

* Your code will be tested using the Java API, NOT based on printed output

* The score will be out of 564 points, which will be mapped to 5% of your grade in Data Structures.
